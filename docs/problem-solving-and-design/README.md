# Problem Solving and Design Notes

* Big Picture comes first

Questions to ask in designing requirements for an application: 

1. Why? - why use it?
2. Who? - who is it for?
3. How? - how does it work?

Components for creating an application

1. Experience (how does the user use/interact with it?)
    * design
    * mockup
    * color
    * flow(screen)

2. Logic 
    * service functionality
    * dependencies
    * security
3. Data
    * Redundancy
    * security
    * availability

## Technical requirements for a fictional app

1. Button
2. Sends a request to a server and API
3. API service uses internal modules to save & return 
4. Database gets read & updated with old and new data, respectively





## Product related interview question

1. Might not be presented with the "Why" question initially - Ask
2. "Who" typically told, if not ask (User/programmer/another app/etc.) to help with coming up with the solution
3. In prompt



## Data model first, interactions (API) second





## Prompt (Product requirement ex.)

Mobile app that has a button that, when pressed, presents an onscreen number to go up. Addt. admin ability to see a user's number of presses on the button
