# Buttons and Presses Problem

## Problem

A company you're interviewing for has created a mobile app and an admin app that has some very rudimentary visual design and functionality: a button and a label for the number of button presses. They don't have an API or a database designed yet to handle the storage of information or the interaction between the mobile app and the admin app.

To move forward, they need to find an employee/consultant that's capable of designing these two pieces and how they interact. It doesn't matter what platforms or frameworks you choose so long as the solution is elegant and simple.

## Challenge

1. Choose technologies (platforms and frameworks) that would be best applicable when designing a solution for this problem.
2. Design the data models for the information stored within your proposed solution.
3. Design the API for the interaction/communication between the apps and the API service.
4. Be prepared for any ad hoc requirement changes or advanced conceptual questions the interviewer might throw at you. This may include considerations for any of the following items:
    1. Performance
    2. Pagination
    3. Error Handling
    4. Breaking Change Handling
    5. Versioning
    6. Filtering

## Product Requirements

1. As a mobile app user, I want an API that allows me to send button presses, so that it may store my data.
2. As an admin app user, I want an API that allows me to get user information, so that I can see the button presses for any given user.
3. As an API service, I want a database with a schema that supports incoming button presses for a given user, so that I may persist data for future retrieval.

It appears you'll need to determine these yourself.
