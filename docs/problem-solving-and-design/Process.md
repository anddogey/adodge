# Process

1. Listen to/read the prompt. ***REALLY*** absorb the requirements mentioned, directly/indirectly.
2. Think about what pieces are involved: actors(doing an actions), handlers(having something done to them), storage.
3. Think about how to connect the pieces in a diagram.
4. Ask if any pieces currently exist. if so ask about the additional context re: the pieces. if not, ask if there are any preferred specs.
5. Write a list of product requirements.
6. Translate them to a list of technical requirements.
7. Design the data models (typically in SQL).
8. Design the API (typically in REST)
9. Walkthrough expanded features for more advanced considerations (filtering, performance, versioning)
10. Be ready to iterate per changing requirements.



## There's a button...

* All brand new, no previous software preferences, product vs. technical, REST API + SQL DB, etc....



1. Understand the problem. (There's a button)
2. Clarify the context. (All brand new, no prev. software preferences)
3. Translate the requirements. (Product vs. technical)
4. Attempt a  solution. (REST API + SQL DB)
5. Reconsider and iterate.  (.... But what if?)
