# Agile, Scrum, and SAFe

## Introduction

### Waterfall Methodology

* Waterfall methodologies - sequential development process that down like a waterfall through all phases, each one completing before passing onto next phase

* Why did we change off Waterfall? Time changed, consumer habits changed. Less time to respond in new market, ability to respond quickly with increased competition in market
* Waterfall best used when teams are small and the project is expected to move in a predictable manner
* Waterfall example flow: Requirements & gathering -> System Design -> Implementation -> Testing (can go back to System Design) -> Delivery/deployment -> Maintenance (Feeds back into Requirements)
* Disadvantages: Making changes takes time, inherently difficult, doesn't focus on the end-user/client, testing phase is delayed until most of the project is already done, and measuring the progress within stages is difficult when all isolated

### What is Agile?

* Introduced in 2001, included manifesto of principles (12 points) 
* Agile: Enables teams to deliver value to their customers with ease, lets teams deliver work in small, but usable increments, and Evaluations of the requirement plans, and results, can take place continuously. No separation/waiting on individual teams. Allows teams to respond to changes quickly
* Concepts detailed in the "agile manifesto"
* Values: Individual and Interactions, Working Products, Customer Collaborations, and Responding to Changes preferred OVER Processes and Tools, Comprehensive Documentation, Contract Negotiations, and Following a plan
* Advantages of Agile: Large amounts of interaction between the client and project team, Improved transparency between company and clients in every phase of the project, Delivery of the output is predictable and can be sometimes early than expected
* Advantages cont.: Allows for changes to refine and re-prioritize the product backlog, the Client can provides the priority of the features they want, allowing the team to ensure maximum project value, 



### Agile Principles

* 1st: Customer Satisfaction: Satisfy the customer early and quickly deliver the product, collaborating with the customer to know what they want
* 2nd: Be welcome to change: Changing needs should be addressed, even late in the development process. Accommodate changes because they're okay.
* 3rd: Deliver Frequently: Ensure software is delivered frequently, focusing on a shorter timescale. Eventually leads to a product with lots of features and lets customers respond to these features.
* 4th: Work Together: Developers and business individuals need to work together through the course of the project. No discourse, open communication between individuals.
* 5th: Motivated Team: Projects need to be built around motivated individuals and they need to be trusted to get the job done. Keep the team motivated.
* 6th: Face-to-Face: Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient means of communication. Easiest way to understand each other.
* 7th: Working Software: Working software is the primary measure of progress. Expect the customer to give feedback on the product and how usable it is.
* 8: Constant Pace: Agile process should promote sustainable development. Development should keep constant.
* 9th: Good Design: Agility can be improved by focusing on technical excellence and good design. Should be derived from full efforts to designing  something that fulfills the purpose. 
* 10th: Simplicity: The amount of work that's not being done needs to be minimized. The most simple and optimized way to do something should be preferred.
* 11th: Self-Organization: Self-organized teams provide the best architectures, requirements, and designs for what they do and take ownership for their duties
* 12th: Reflect and Adjust: Effectiveness can be improved by the team regularly reflecting on it. The team should be accountable for actions and reflect.

### Agile Methodologies

Extreme Programming

* A framework that enables teams to create high-quality software and improves their quality of life
* Enables software development with the appropriate engineering practices

* APPLICABLE WHEN: Changing software requirements
* Handle risks caused due to new technology
* Working with a small, extended development team
* To use technology to allow automated unit and functional tests

Kanban

* Method is used to design, manage, and improve the flow of systems
* Organizations can visualize their flow of work and limiting their work in progress
* APPLICABLE WHEN: It can be used in situations where work arrives in an unpredictable fashion
* Used to deploy work immediately, without waiting for other work items

Lean

* A set of tools and principles that aims to identify and remove waste to increase the speed of process development
* Focuses on maximizing value to the client, ensuring waste is minimized
* APPLICABLE WHEN: Apply to any sector where there's waste of any form

Scrum*

* Framework that is used by teams to establish a hypothesis, try it out, reflect on the experience, and adjust
* Used to enable teams to incorporate practices from other frameworks depending on the team's requirements
* APPLICABLE WHEN: Cross-functional teams are working on product development when work is split into more than 2-4 week iterations

Crystal

* Approach software development that focuses on people and their interactions, rather than tools and processes.
* Aimed to streamline processes and improve optimization
* Works on the principle that projects are unique and dynamic; Each requiring its specific mehtods
* APPLICABLE WHEN: Its focus is on strengthening team communication
* Continuous integration, active user involvement, and configurable processes

## Scrum

History of Scrum

* Introduced by Japanese experts in 1986
* 1995 Early versions of Agile methodology 
* 2001 Agile Alliance and first book of scurm founded
* Scrum Inc 200
* 2009 Scrum.org created
* 2010 Scrum Guide is published

What is Scrum?

* Framework that enables teams to work together
* With Scrum teams can:
* Learn from experiences, self-organize working on problems
* reflect on their victories and losses to improve

Benefits:

* Teams can provide project deliverables in an efficient manner 
* Time and money used efficiently
* Projects are divided into smaller units called ***Sprints***
* Working best for fast moving projects
* Scrum meetings provide team great visibility
* Constantly involves feedback from clients and customers
* Making changes based on feedback are very easy
* Individual efforts of the team members are given focus

Scrum Teams involve:

* Product owner- Primarily responsible for maximizing the ROI by determining the product features and prioritizing features into a list, what needs to be focused on for the next sprint, and constantly reprioritizing and refining 
* Scrum Master- Helps teams learn and apply scrum to obtain business value. They help remove impediments, protects them from interference,a nd helps team to adopt agile practices.
* Scrum Team- Collection of individuals that work together to deliver the requirements of the stakeholders

Scrum Artifacts-

* Components of he Scrum process that can improve transparency and understanding of the work. Three artifacts:
* Product Backlog- Consists of a list of new features, changes  made to existing features, bug fixes, changes to the infrastructure and several other activities that teams need to deliver to ensure a specific outcome
* Sprint Backlog- Subset of product backlog, the spring contains tasks that the team aims to complete to satisfy the sprint goal.Team first identifies tasks from the product backlog that needs to be delivered to achieve a goal. Then added to backlog
* Product Increment- Combination of all product backlog tasks completed in a sprint and the value of increments of previous sprints, Outcome should be in usable condition, even if the product owner doesn't decide to release it

Scrum Framework-

* Product Backlog-> Sprint Planning -> Sprint Backlog -> Scrum Team with daily scrum -> Sprint review leading to retrospective  and backlog -> Increment
* Prod. Backlog- First step, set up a list of tasks to successfully achieve the goal of stakeholders
* Sprint Planning- Determines the tasks from prod cat they will work on and aim to deliver
* sprint backlog- tasks discussed during script planning, added to the sprint backlog
* team- 5-9 people working on tasks from sprint backlog
* Daily scrum- 15 min session events where team synchronizes activities and plan what to aim to achieve for the day
* Review- involves all members included prod owner and stakeholders, shows what has been accomplished, presents backlog's top for stakeholders to review, 
* Retrospective- reflect on previous day, any issues, goods/bads, etc.
* Increment- workable output given to stakeholders

Scrum Board-

* Physical/virtual tool that helps team visualize items in the sprint backlog
* Shows all action items during the dialy scru, helping keep the team focused on the tasks that need completion and their priorities
* Usually present in a place that's accessible to all members
* Divided into slots like To-do, In Progress, and Done
* When started, existing board is reset, new scrum board created

## Agile Project Management

* Way by which a project can be managed by breaking it into several stages or Sprints
* Allows Teams to release segments of the project that are completed
* Doesn't require a project maanager to have a central control

* Prod backlog, spring backlog, Spring, final product

Why Agile Proj Mgmt?

* High product quality, ensure high product quality testing is performed all through the project development process teams perform regular check-ups to improve the project quality 

* Customer Satisfaction- customer have full knowledge of what is being done, continuous and fast delivery, customer can give changes at any point in the project

* Reduced Risk- divided into sprints, so even if the risk is vulnerable, in the first sprint, it will not affect the 2nd, risk analysis simultaneously done with other project processes, easy adaptation to the client's requirements through dev phase

* Better & Faster ROI- Product completed in several versions, market-ready after a few versions, fast release of the project & helps to stay ahead in competition of other companies, projects that take a long time can be deployed earlier and released as beta versions

Principles of Agile Proj Mgmt
* Customer Satisfied from fast and continuous delivery
*  Shortened time period between planning and delivery
* Mgmt and devs work together for better understanding and prod. work
* Accepting stakeholder changes, even late in process
* Better coordination with team members
* Monitoring project progress at each iteration & finding solutions when needed
* Trust & support the tam to complete the project's objs
* Face-to-Face comms as most efficient method of conveying info
* Requirements understood & simplest solution to meet those requirements is taken
* Scrum tools used to clean up confusing code to save time

Six Steps in Agile Proj Methodology:
* Project Planning- ensures everyone understand end goal & value of project. Scope is developed, work is estimated by breaking down into sprints/Iterations
* Roadmap Creation- List of all features final prod should have. Plan of acition on how a project will evolve.
* Release planing- Includes feature releases, revisited at beginning of each sprint. AGMeth uses shorter dev cycles/sprints, features released at the end of each cycle
* Sprint planning- Ensures each team member has assigned task before sprint starts, make sure work is evenly divided
* Daily meetings- help team in accomplishing daily tasks in efficient manner
* Review and retrospective- Teams inspect itself & plan to make changes to improve coming sprints. Retro follows review, before next sprint planning

## Agile User Stories
* What it is- agile software development-proj mgmt tool, provides users with simple, natural lang explanations of one or more features written from the end-user's perspective
* Doesn't go into detail, just mention how a certain type of work will bring value to the end-user
* End-user meaning external users or internal customer or colleagues within organization
* Form building block of agile frameworks like epics & initiatives
* ensures teams work to the goals of organization
* requirements for making a user story- reality added later after discussing with team
* Recorded on post-it notes, index cards, or proj. mgmt software

Advantages:

* Delivery high quality content. eases collab with team members, understand users better, improves transparency, reduces risks, supports iterative development, Focuses on vocal comms

INVEST-

* Concept that helps create meaningful user stories
* Independent- stories should be indep. of one another, each can be developed and delivered separately
* Negotiable- discussable and open for negotiation
* Valuable- Ensure values being added to the customers
* Estimable- can be divided into tasks and be estimable
* Small- Shouldn't' bee too big and be co0mpleted in about 40 hrs or 3-4 days
* Testable- acceptable criteria that can be tested to check if they fulfill customer's needs

How to Write story

* As a [role], I [want to], [so that]
* Role- an individual that would be interacting with the system
* Want to- behavior of the system, action is unique to each story
* So that- result/benefit that's non-functional and external to the system

3C's of User Stories-

* Card- provides written desc. of story. Used for planning & estimation
* Conversation- discussion between users, team, product owners, etc. helps build a shared understanding
* Confirmation- conditions that need to be satisfied to ensure the story meets requirements

Life cycle of a story-

* Pending- Created after communicating with user and project team. reminder for further discussion
* To-do- User stories needed to be addressed are decided and put into sprints
* Discussion- Users confirm the requirements and acceptance of criteria. end-users shown a preview of upcoming features
* Developing-Team able to design and implement features to fulfill requirements
* Confirming- end-users confirms user story, features confirmed through testing environments/alpha version and the acceptance criteria
* Finished- completed, new requirements / new user story must be created

Mapping

* represents and arranges user stories to help with understanding system's functionalities, system's backlog, planning releases, and providing value to customers
* arrange user stories based on priorities along horizonal axis
* vertical - based on level of sophistication
* Advantages- Helps prioritize work, focus is on user value, Roadblocks are highlighted, ensuring team unity, focus on constant improvement 

## Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

Effective ways to scale agile: 

* Large- Scale Scrum (LeSS)
* Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
* Disciplined Agile (DAD)
* Scrum at Scale
* Nexus Scrum
* Spotify Model

SAFe

* Collection of principles & best practices & processes that enable large organizations to adopt agile methodologies
* help deliver products faster
* Best suited for complex projects that involve several large teamsat the project, program,& portfolio levels
* current version of SAFe (V 5.0) has 7 core competencies based on which can help large organizations

Core Values -

* Alignment: required to keep up with change, competition, and geographically separated teams
* Built-in Quality: ensures every component and increment maintains quality throughout the dev lifecycle
* Transparency: enables teams to rely on each other, build high-performance programs and meet reasonable commitments
* Program Execution: SAFe's focus on working systems and business outcomes

How does it work-

* Team and Technical Agility: Agile team of 5-11 define, build, test, and deploy products in iterations, using scrum/kanban
* Agile Product Delivery: several agile teams, each led by resp. scrum masters. teams work together, represent ART (Agile Release Trains), usually 50-125 ppl, ARTs cross-functional & involve everyone who understand customer needs & can help with building & delivering the solutions they need, use agile delivery practice, use timeboxed iterations called Program Increments (PIs), 5 iterations, 3 major components required: release trai engineer- represents coach of the ART, facilitated the PI planning process, project mgmt- provides vision for the project & backlog of tasks, system architect- provides architectural guidance for the process, continuous delivery pipeline set up, DevOps practices used to ensure value is available on demand
* Enterprise Solution Delivery: able to provide solutions in large & complex scenarios, same major components
* Lean Portfolio Mgmt: Provides way of creating & combining strategic themes & portfolio vision, enables solution development to be aligned with the enterprises' strategy, ensures values in value streams & streams remain funded
* Organizational Agility: enabling portfolios with strategic agility, making change in direction of the scenario, encouraging growth of lean thinking people & agile teams, focus on value, helping with organizing, building an environment for the flow of value across the org., 
* Continuous Learning Culture: atmosphere of innovation & constant improvement until the organization becomes a learning org., keeps company understanding of new technology tos tay with competition
* Lean- Agile Leadership: leaders must: embody, teach, understand lean  & Agile, principles,values, and exhibit to ensure business agility

SAFe Configurations

* Essential SAFe: Foundation of all SAFe configs, easiest starting point for implementation
* Large Solution SAFe: Building large & complex solutions
* Portfolio SAFe: provides principles & strategies that enable business agility in an enterprise
* Full SAFe: Comprehensive configuration that includes all 7 competencies to ensure business agility 
* Advantages: Enables de-centralized decision making, eases collaboration across cross-functional teams, ensures decisions are made with strategic objs. in mind
* Disadvantages: Addt. layers of oversight make it resemble waterfall methodology, top-down approach can limit understanding of software lifecycle & cause bad planning, longer planning cycles & roles that are fixed in development cycles

## Agile Vs Waterfall

* Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)- Designing, developing, and testing high quality software, create best quality software keeping in mind customer's expectations & deadlines, defines tasks to be performed
* Stages: planning, defining, designing, building, testing, deployment

Waterfall-

* Earliest SDLC, each phase completed before beginning next phase, next phase depends on deliverables of last phase, sequential, top-down approach

Agile-

* promotes continuous iteration of dev and testing all through the SDLC, ensures rapid delivery of all components of the project that are completely functional, divided into sprints, defined duration with decided deliverables, reviewed by project team and customer with help of daily builds, high level of customer involvement through project, 
* five stages: initiation, planning, development, release, retirement

Differences-

* Life Cycle- Agility continuous iteration, waterfall is sequential
* Rigidity- Agile very flexible, waterfall extremely rigid and structured way
* Collaboration, agile highly collaborative towards dev, waterall least flexible
* Agile- divided into sprints, waterfall- broken into phases
* changes- agile can be made even after initial planning is completed, waterfall dev requirements cannot be changed once proj dev. begins 
* soft dev: agile- collection of many different projects, waterfall model soft dev is completed as single project/deliverable
* testing- agile performed in same iteration, waterfall testing later in sequence
* focus: agile focuses on customer satisfactions, waterfall follows finishing project
* projects: agile: suited for projects where requirements change and involve, waterfall no expected changes
* customer satisfaction: agile focused on it, involving them through dev phase, waterfall more internal process, not requiring customer participation

## Scrum Vs Agile

* Agile- Set of principles that's iterative and incremental,
* Scrum- Implementation of agile methodology
* Agile suited for small teams, Scrum used where requirements are constantly changing
* Agile leadership project head takes care of all tasks and vital to project, Scrum no leader, self-organized teams
* Agile - cannot handle changes frequently, scrum can
* Agile- requires frequent deliver to the end user, Scrum with sprints builds are delivered to clients for feedback
* Collab- Agile, face-to-face interactions, Scrum uses daily stand-up meetings to help with collab
* design- Agile design is simple, Scrum design & execution can be innovative and experimental



## Scrum Vs Kanban

* Kanban- visual system used for managing work through project, can determine bottlenecks, can fix them in cost-effective manner, transparency. Work divided into small pieces and divided on the board
* Works with To-do list, ongoing, and done
* Both Scrum & Kanban use lean and Agile, reduce work in progress, work divided into pieces, use pull scheduling, transparency drives process improvement, release release plan optimized continuously, releasable software delivered often and early
* Differences: 
* Cadences- Scrum divided into time-constrained iterations (sprints) kanban event-driven
* Release- scrum take place at end of each sprint, Kanban releases in the form of continuous delivery
* Changes- Scrum cannot be considered during sprint, kanban can
* metric- scrum velocity is default metric, used in planning & process improvement
