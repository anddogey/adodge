## 07/01 Meeting

* Why is the market wonky? - Lots of overhiring, trends for layoffs likely. Partially tied to remote. Recession. 
* Structure of resume/projects? - Keep education tab low on resume. Accomplishments should be prioritized, e.g. 'I saved __ hours, I caught this critical bug and ...' Remember to word projects in a marketable way.
* Posting online? - Do it. Stop being reclusive. Learn to post on social media/Linkedin for marketing purposes. 
* Future opportunities? - Jason's company potentially looking for fullstack interface page using Angular. Doesn't require knowing C# fully by that pointed.
