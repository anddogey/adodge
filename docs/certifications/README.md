# Certifications & Bootcamps

## Key Points on Bootcamps

* There are 3 primary benefits with boot camps:

    1. Learning how to function individually and cooperatively within a team by learning concepts and applying them in a series of projects.
    2. Receiving a certificate of formal education — something that stands out on a LinkedIn profile.
    3. Landing that first junior developer position through some sort of assistance program.

* Here are 3 counter-arguments against boot camps:

    1. You can learn all you need to know, individually and cooperatively, through personal and connected efforts **outside of a bootcamp**. If you have other engineering buddies you can pair with to create something, that works — but you can also learn independently. The most important thing here is that you either already have or learn to **obtain a strength in problem solving and nonstandardized learning**.

    2. Certificates of formal education are nice and everything... but they prove next to nothing in terms of a broader, deeper understanding of engineering when they don't come from a prestigous, well-renowned program. Bootcamps can range from $15 Udemy courses up to ~$20k, year-long, full-time, standardized education — and it is this ridiculous range that lends skeptisism. If you're gonna get certified in something that isn't a CS degree, make it platform-specific, like in AWS. What's most important here is that you have proof of **experience**, not necessarily *education*. Both the ability to learn efficiently and effectively and the ability to solve a variety of problems can be shown through **LinkedIn activity and a respectable GitHub profile.**

    3. Assistance programs and hire-rate reporting are truly sketchy by nature because the percentage of individuals that ended up finding a job post-camp-graduation is not reliable. This is due to both (1) the lack of clarity on how many individuals got hired into the program that trained them — a cycle that leads to an echo chamber of dated knowledge — and (2) correlation vs causation — a theory that these individuals got jobs not because of their new certificate and prestige but rather because of the following:

        1. Personality
        2. Adept ability to learn without hand-holding
        3. Proof of experience
        4. Connections (typically alumni)

        Ultimately, these items can be perfected or obtained without the need for a bootcamp**. Building a network of positive professionals that will advertise your brilliant persona and portfolio will drastically increase your likelihood of obtaining a job.**

## Quotes on Bootcamps

* "Yes, some students can get a lot out of boot camps, but these are always the ones that already have a lot of the qualities that make good engineers (attention to detail, good critical thinking and problem solving skills, etc)."
    * Bootcamps may convert nobodies into beginners or beginners into intermediates, but 99% fail to convert people into **excellent** engineers — individuals who are curious, imaginative, and astute learners. These bootcamps fail because they only dive into the practices and processes of a software engineer without giving way for the right level of creative thought and deductive reasoning, practicing repetitively to reinforce the skills of critical thinking and problem solving.
    * If your goal is only to learn what it means to **qualify** as an engineer, to generate proof of education and experience, and to *possibly* land a job, most bootcamps will work for you.
    * If your goal is to also refine your critical thinking and problem solving skills, learning what it means to **be** an engineer, most bootcamps will fail to provide enough for you. Instead, (1) find mentors, (2) complete a more narrow, prestiguous certification, (3) generate your own proof of experience, and (4) build a network through your mentors.
* "You can "know" a programming language by doing lots of memorization. But the "skill" is something you build by experience."
    * Programming is only an expression of critical thinking and problem solving as skills. Developing proficiency with a programming language is similar to the process required for any other subject in that one thing remains constant: repetition. To develop the skills themselves, you need to be repetitively exposed to new problems, both similar and different from eachother in a variety of ways, solving them through abstract, conceptual, and design-oriented ways. This will create a robust understanding of how to break down a problem and solve it without even writing a single line of code.
