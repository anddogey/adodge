# RDS (Relational DB service)

* Used to host SQL items in clusters
* Clusters contain instances
* Clusters
* Instances are a part of the cluster in that they hold a portion or a copy of the data.
* The throughput is "load balanced"
* Another word for instances =  replicas. 
* Information gets stored in the Ether in some manner
* Consistency is very important - You want to avoid multiple connections/subsequent connections to have stale data.
* Typically we use SQL for RDS Clusters.
