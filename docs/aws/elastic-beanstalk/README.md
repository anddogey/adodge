# Elastic Beanstalk

* Meant to host web applications
* Runs on a similar architecture to Lambdas
    * Although you may have 1 application, you can have multiple instances / multiple versions
    * Instance is the running version of the application, the version is the code itself (1.1 of the code, 1.2, etc)
