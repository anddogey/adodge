# Ping Research Notes

### Ready for deployment?

* Last stage in software development life cycle (SDLC), consists of steps ordering planning the deployment, verifying service components with unit and integration testing, verifying the target envinronments through ensuring the host environments are ready for accepting the software packages, executing the deployment pushing the software into the environment and conducting the relevant systems tests, and confirming the deployment through validating that the customer's requirements are met.

### Ready for review?

* Comparable to either integration in SDLC, where new code is combined and validated that it works with existing code before being pushed for testing. Could also relate to the staging environment in the SDLC where the software is tested using reald ata to validate it is ready for use prior to being pushed to production and deployment. 

### Ready for validation(QA specifically)?

* Process of ensuring if the tested and devleoped software satisfies the client /user needs. Includes gathering the business requirements for validation from the end user, preparing a business plan with approval from stakeholders, writing test cases 

### Done?

### What are some ways we can format our Agile retrospective meetings at the end of a sprint?

* 

### What are some ways we can format our Agile planning/grooming meetings at the beginning or middle of a sprint?

* 

 ### What does it mean to develop scalable, strong architecture and data models?

* 

### What are some industry-standardized tools that software engineers or data engineers use in their day-to-day? What are some up-and-coming tools that might be worth looking into? (Look for blogs, discords, slacks, and subreddits)
